To view the notebooks on this website, just click them, and they will render and be readable.

If you want to rerun them, and the analysis of the included data, **you need to install git-lfs** as described [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

This will allow the data files to be downloaded (in total ~500MB).

When you have installed `git-lfs`, clone this repository, and inside the repository folder do `git lfs pull` to get the files.
